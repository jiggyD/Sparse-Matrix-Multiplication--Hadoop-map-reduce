# Sparse-Matrix-Multiplication--Hadoop-map-reduce

-The application uses 2 map reduce jobs.  
-First job reads the input matrices and multiplies corresponding values.The second job does summation of all the products.  
-Input matrix:  
 Two small sparce matrices 4x3 and 3x3 in the files M-matrix-small.txt and N-matrix-small.txt   
-Result will be stored in result-matrix-small.txt
